# Global Crop Yield 
This project is part of DSA2101 (Essential Data Analytics Tools: Data Visualisation) module at the National University of Singapore. 
The project is based on the Global Crop Yield datasets from Github's Tidy Tuesday project. For more info on datasets: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-09-01

The project aims to create a greater appreciation of our food source by analyzing and explore the trends in the yields of various types of crops across the years 
as well as discovering how they could be profoundly affected by economic, political, and ecological factors.
